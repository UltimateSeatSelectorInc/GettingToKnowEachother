		<h2 style="color: darkred">Introduction</h2>
		<p style="float: left; width: 700px">My name is Connor Thompson. I am currently a Senior at Lewis University and am going for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I currently am planning on doing web development, with a possibility of future video game development. I have a little brother named Caleb who is currently in seventh grade. My dad currently works as an Uber driver and my mom is a nurse. I enjoy playing video games such as Destiny 2 and learning new things.</p>

			<h2 style="color: darkred">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
				<p style="float: left; width: 700px">My favorite hobby is reading. Ever since I was very young and first learned to read I have been fascinated by books. The ability to remove yourself from the real world and cast your imagination into these incredible fantasy and sci-fi worlds has always been cool to me, and so I have continued reading. My favorite genre is fantasy, but I also love Star Wars books and other stories similar to them. Today, I can consistenly finish a book I find interesting within a couple of days and often find myself lost in the book so much so that hours can go by without me consciously noticing. Anyways, that is by far my favorite thing to do.</p>
